# Share to Extensions

In LumApps, users can share contents and posts to external services depending on their connected services. 
With the Marketplace, this feature can be extended to offer new way of sharing LumApps content and to connect LumApps with new services.

You can find more information on how to share content in LumApps with this [documentation](https://docs.lumapps.com/docs/use-l22847781442806436).

## Extension structure
To implement a Share To extension you'll have to develop the content of the Sharing dialog. You'll be free to ask any kind of information to the user to do the sharing of its content.

</span>

## Extension manifest
For this kind of extension you'll have to add some specific information in your extension manifest file.
In oder to display your extension in the list of available sharing service, we'll need the **name of your service**, and a **logo for your service**.
