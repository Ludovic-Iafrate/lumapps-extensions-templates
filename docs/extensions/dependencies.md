# Extension dependencies

When developing your extension, you can add dependencies.
As your extension will be loaded by the LumApps platform you cannot use any library you want, but we provide a list of authorized extensions for your extension.

Here is the list of available libraries : 

| library                                              | version    | description            |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :--------------------- |
| [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)              | "^0.18.0"  |                        |
| [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)           | "4.17.19"  |                        |
| lumapps-sdk-js                                       | "0.0.41"   | LumApps Javascript SDK |

If you use a dependency which is not in that list, your extension may not render in the LumApps platform.

If you have a specific need, you can contact us.
